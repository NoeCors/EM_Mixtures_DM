# EM_Mixtures_DM
EM algorithm for estimating the Deep Dirichlet Multinomial distribution and its first two moments.

An application to real data is provided in file "Application_CancerData.R" together with the data used ("cancer_data.csv").
Moreover a comparison between this model other likelihood-based models for extra-variation is developed both in the data application and in two different simulation studies.

A more deep and detailed explenation can be found in the following article:
